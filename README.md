<h1>⚡️ Catch Them All!</h1>

<h2>🕸 Description</h2>
<div>
    <p>
      &nbsp; At the top of the screen, there are white and red spheres arranged like pokeballs. You control a cube player that can move left or right using the arrow keys. Your goal is to catch as many pokeballs as you can within 30 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;The cube player has colorful particles created with shaders, adding a visually appealing touch. You can change the perspective of the game by moving the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Using HTML controls, you can adjust the number of pokeballs generated and change the game's theme. Pressing the "R" key resets the game, while pressing "P" pauses it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Enjoy the game and try to catch as many pokeballs as possible within the time limit!
